Title:Payment Systems Analysis Dashboard
INTRODUCTION
After successfully completing an online video course on Power BI, taught by Kevin Knights on the "Learn with the Nerds" YouTube channel, I was inspired to undertake this project. I decided to use this dataset since it was the same dataset I utilized for my undergraduate project. 
OBJECTIVES
The aim of this project is to comprehend the evolution of payment systems in Nigeria over the past decade. Specific objectives have been established to accomplish this goal, which include:

Thoroughly analyzing the usage patterns of various payment methods in Nigeria over the last decade.
Predicting the future most sought-after payment systems in Nigeria based on the usage patterns of the past decade.
